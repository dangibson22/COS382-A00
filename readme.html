**A00 - Comparing Languages**

This is a sample write up for the A00_LanguageComparison assignment.


<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

![Ada program giving prime partitions for 42](./ada/ada-output.png width="600px")<br>
Implementatiing Ada was made easier through the use of a few helper functions.
First, I define the `Is_Prime` function to return whether an integer N is a prime number or not.
I then have the `Primes` function, which uses the `GetListLength` function to help this process.
The `GetListLength` function takes a range of numbers and returns the count of prime numbers in that range.
This value is then used to define the length of the `PrimesList` array created at the start of `Primes`.
For each number in the range, I check if it's a prime, and if so it is added to `PrimesList`.
One nice feature of this implementation is that the program knows when the last prime number in the range is found, so it can simply return at that point.
With these helper functions defined, I then move to the `Prime_Partitions` function.
One unique part of this implementation is that I don't need to create a fixed size list at the start of the program.
Instead, each time the recursive function is called, I create a new list called `NewPList` that
has a length of 1 greater than the input `PList`. I then copy each element from `PList` over to `NewPList`
and when I call `Primes` (which works nicely as an iterable), I add the new value to the end of `NewPList`.
I then recursively call `Prime_Partitions` passing `NewPList` as the `PList` parameter.
Other then that, the function looks fairly similar to the Python solution provided by Dr. Denning (apart from the obvious semantic differences).

![Prolog program giving prime partitions for 42](./prolog/prolog-output.png width="600px")<br>

Prolog was a very odd language to work with. However, I was able to put together a working solution.
There are definitely better ways to use the Prolog language to solve this problem, but as I am quite unfamilliar
with Prolog I wasn't able to implement those. My solution still gets the job done. I start with a predicate `isPrime` to
determine whether a number is prime or not. It uses a recursive predicate `divisible` to check whether a number is divisible
by any other number.
Since Prolog doesn't allow for return values, I wasn't able to implement a `primes` predicate to neatly give a list of primes.
I instead built the desired functionality of `primes` into the `primePartitions` predicate. I use the `between` predicate to generate
a list of numbers, the `isPrime` predicate to discern which numbers are primes, and the `forall` predicate to iterate through the list.
I also `append` the current prime `P` to the input list of primes `List` and assign that to `NewList`, which I then pass to `primePartitions`.
Since Prolog handles I/O weirdly, I didn't try and set up an infinite loop to handle user input, but otherwise it functions the same.

Scheme was a bit tricky to get used to at first but ended up quite similar to the Python implementation.
I as able to use the `for-each` function to iterate cleanly. I used the `primes` function to generate a list
of prime numbers in the specified range, which worked quite well as an iterable for the `for-each` function. 
As with Prolog, Scheme doesn't have loops, so I had to create multiple recursive functions, but this wasn't
too difficult. Additionally, since Scheme is a functional language, the use of lambdas throughout made it easier 
to define specific processes that wouldn't be repeated elsewhere in the program.
