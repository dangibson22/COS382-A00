% divisible is a recursive predicate that, given if X and Y, range(Y, X) is divisible by X
divisible(X, Y) :- 0 is X mod Y, !.
divisible(X, Y) :- X > Y + 1, divisible(X, Y+1).

% tells if number is prime.
% - 2 is prime
% - 1 or lower is not prime
% - number is prime if it is not divisible by any other number
isPrime(X) :-
  X = 2 -> true ;
  X < 2 -> false ;
  not(divisible(X, 2)).
